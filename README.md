# Blockchain-Based-Degree-Issuance-And-Verification-System

This project is a Blockchain-Based Degree Issuance and Verification System designed to make academic certificates secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. It leverages blockchain technology with a Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism to ensure that degrees once issued cannot be altered or forged. The system introduces a multi-role approval workflow where a student requests a certificate, and the request is processed sequentially by the Registrar, Dean, and Controller. Only after all three authorities approve, the certificate is permanently recorded on the blockchain, updated in the database, and made available for download in PDF format.

The solution is built with a Flask (Python) backend that provides REST APIs for certificate issuance, validation, and verification, while PostgreSQL is used for secure storage of users and certificate data. A JSON-based blockchain file maintains the immutable chain of records. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides three separate interfaces: a Student Dashboard where students can request and track certificates, an Admin Panel where Registrar, Dean, and Controller can approve requests, and a Public Verification Portal where employers or institutions can instantly validate the authenticity of a degree.

The system architecture ensures a transparent flow. A student initiates a request, which passes through the approval hierarchy before being finalized on the blockchain. Once approved, the student can download the certificate, and anyone can verify it publicly through the portal. This prevents degree fraud, simplifies the verification process, and builds trust in academic credentials.

The project is organized into a modular structure. The backend contains blockchain logic, database models, controllers, services, and utilities, while the frontend includes static resources (CSS and JavaScript), templates for students, administrators, and the public verification portal. A dedicated blockchain.json file stores blockchain data, and PostgreSQL manages users and certificates.

To set up the system, clone the repository and install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Configure the PostgreSQL database in config.py and initialize the blockchain file. Once the backend server is running, the frontend can be accessed in the browser, allowing students, administrators, and external verifiers to interact with the system.

This project provides a real-world solution to degree verification, addressing academic fraud while offering students and institutions a professional, easy-to-use, and blockchain-powered platform for certificate issuance and validation.
